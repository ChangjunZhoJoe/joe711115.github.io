<h1>OnlyChat Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Privacy Policy

OnlyChat utilizes state-of-the-art security and end-to-end encryption to provide private messaging and Internet calling services to users worldwide (“Services”). Your calls are always encrypted, so they can never be shared or viewed by anyone but yourself and the intended recipients.

Information you provide

Account Information. You register a phone number when you create a OnlyChat account. Phone numbers are used to provide our Services to you and other OnlyChat users. You may optionally add other information to your account, such as a profile name and profile picture. This information is end-to-end encrypted.

Additional technical information is stored on our servers, including randomly generated authentication tokens, keys, push tokens, and other material that is necessary to establish calls and transmit messages. OnlyChat limits this additional technical information to the minimum required to operate the Services.

Contacts. OnlyChat can optionally discover which contacts in your address book are OnlyChat users, using a service designed to protect the privacy of your contacts. Information from the contacts on your device may be cryptographically hashed and transmitted to the server in order to determine which of your contacts are registered.

User Support. If you contact OnlyChat User Support, any personal data you may share with us is kept only for the purposes of researching the issue and contacting you about your case.

Managing your information. You can manage your personal information in OnlyChat’s application Settings. For example, you can update your profile information or choose to enable additional privacy features like a Registration Lock PIN.
